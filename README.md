# Overview

I'm Jorge Mejorada and this is a simple but funny game, everyone could play it, it is entertaining, I know that to develop my software skills I should practice as much as I can, every project I work on at university and as personal projects I save them.
so I could be able to build a strong portfolio for tech companies when asking for a job, my philosophy in this career as in many other places of my life is: "Practice improves" I have to be honest I'm not going to be perfect but if I practice every day, 
if every day I study a concept, or a new programming language, if I strive to develop these programs more constantly I inevitably will succeed and earn more knowledge and experience, that's what I want to accomplish when developing these programs,
I want to learn, improve, and dominate this career to be confident to make greater projects.  

This program is a game, Number Guessing Game, this program allows the user to have a certain number of attempts to guess a random number between 1 and 100, the game gives you some hint about how close you are to the mysterious number, 
if you guess the number in the attempts you have you win, otherwise if the number of attempts finishes and you do not guess the number yet, you would lose. I used Java language to develop this program, Java is an object-oriented programming language, that can be used in
Windows, Mac, Linux, and others, are one of the most popular programming languages in the world and are in high demand in the job market.  

# Purpose

I wrote this program to learn more about Java, I have never worked with Java programming language before and that's why of the purposes of chose to work with this programming language, I learned the basics of this programming language and I developed it.
A small, simple but functional game for people of all ages. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

* Eclipse IDE: Eclipse is widely regarded as the Java development environment. It is an excellent platform for building integrated development environments
* Java: Java is a popular programming language, that is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games, and much more.
Java is a widely used object-oriented programming language and software platform that runs on billions of devices, including notebook computers, mobile devices, gaming consoles, medical devices, and many others. 
* Git/Github: A cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

# Future Work

- I need to work more with loops and conditionals, loops (if, while, for) I did not use all of them in this program
- I should probably make it more interactive.
- Learn and implement the read and write to a file the next week.
